            <h2>What is a Heavy Tractor?</h2>
            <p>A heavy tractor is a large, high-powered piece of agricultural machinery designed for intensive, large-scale farming tasks. These tractors are built to handle demanding operations like plowing, hauling heavy loads, and working with large implements. They typically feature more robust engines and advanced transmission systems to deal with tough field conditions, including rocky or compacted soils.</p>

            <h2>Uses of a Heavy Tractor</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plowing and Tilling:</strong> Heavy tractors can handle large plows to break up deep, compacted soil for large-scale farming.</li>
                <li><strong>Hauling Loads:</strong> They are commonly used to transport heavy loads like harvested crops, equipment, and other materials across large farms.</li>
                <li><strong>Pulling Large Implements:</strong> These tractors can operate larger implements such as deep tillers, large seeders, and other specialized equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Compaction Management:</strong> Heavy tractors can help in breaking up tough soil layers and manage soil compaction in large agricultural operations.</li>
               

    

            <h2>Advantages of Using a Heavy Tractor</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ High Power and Efficiency: Heavy tractors provide the necessary horsepower to handle large and demanding tasks effectively.</li>
                <li>✅ Durability: Built to last, heavy tractors are designed to endure harsh farming conditions and long working hours.</li>
                <li>✅ Increased Productivity: These tractors reduce the time needed to complete large-scale farming operations, increasing overall farm efficiency.</li>
                <li>✅ Multi-Purpose: With the right attachments, heavy tractors can perform a wide variety of farming tasks, from tilling to hauling and even planting.</li>
